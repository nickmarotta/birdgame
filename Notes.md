# Notes from working on the Bird Game

## Gotchas

- I couldn't see the Bird on the screen because I had accidentally set my Camera Z Value to 0. The default is -10 which I assume is for 2D games but maybe not.

## Random Facts

- When loading in sprites for 2D games, make sure that the Texture Type is set to Sprite (2D and UI)
- Sprite Ordering is a thing
- Game tab resolution is a thing
- Creating a particle effect was cool. Had to tweak a bunch of different settings by opening lots of menus.
  - Can create a "prefab" particle effect which makes the effect more tangible and accessible by scripts and game objects.
  - Just drag the particle effect from the hierarchy to the assets window to create a prefab
